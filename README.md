## What is Photon-v2?
Photon-v2 is a rendering engine made out of my personal interest in computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both computer generated. Different from its previous version, Photon, which was written entirely in Java, Photon-v2 utilizes the powerful C++14 for the rendering core and builds a GUI on top of it with Java via JNI. The project is currently in development and more features are expected to come. <br />

## Build
Photon-v2 is being developed with cross-platformity in mind, but Windows is the only platform that has been tested, for now. <br />

(building instructions will be added soon...) <br />
