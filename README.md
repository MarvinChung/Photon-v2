## What is Photon-v2

Photon-v2 is a rendering engine made out of my personal interest in computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both computer simulated. This project is actively being developed and more features are expected to come.

**Supported Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS

## Scene Description Language

The scene description language (SDL) designed by T.C. Chang can be stored into a text file (.p2 filename extension) and loaded by Photon-v2 for rendering. To create a scene, you can either open up a text file and start writing right away (visit "./scenes/" for reference) or install the Blender addon (in "./BlenderAddon/"), which contains a .p2 file exporter and a material editor currently.
